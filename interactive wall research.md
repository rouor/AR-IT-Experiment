interactive touch wall

## Research Lab
The Future Interfaces Group (FIG) is an interdisciplinary research laboratory within the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. We create new sensing and interface technologies that aim to make interactions between humans and computers more fluid, intuitive, and powerful. These efforts often lie in emerging use modalities, such as wearable computing, touch interfaces and gestural interaction.
